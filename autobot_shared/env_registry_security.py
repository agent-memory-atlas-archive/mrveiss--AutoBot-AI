"""Security AUTOBOT_* environment variable registrations.

Split out of ``env_registry.py`` rather than added inline, for the reason that
file's own docstring gives: a new variable goes in an
``env_registry_<component>.py`` sibling. The mechanical reason is the one
``env_registry_logging.py`` records — ``env_registry.py`` sits at its
grandfathered file-size ceiling (#14236) with no slack, and the ratchet forbids
raising a ceiling to make room, so an inline registration cannot land there at
all.

#13602 added the first ``component="security"`` variable, so this is the
component's first home rather than a move of existing entries.

Registration contract (import side effect, ordering): see ``env_registry`` (#16415).
