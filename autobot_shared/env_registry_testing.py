"""Testing-only AUTOBOT_* environment variable registrations.

Split out of ``env_registry.py`` to keep that file under its grandfathered
file-size ceiling (#14236) while making room to register a new "terminal"
component variable there (#14961) — ``env_registry.py`` was already at its
ceiling with no slack for either addition. This is the one "testing"-component
entry that lived at the tail of that file; relocated verbatim rather than
merged into ``env_registry_terminal.py`` so neither sibling file mixes
unrelated components (see ``env_registry_ai.py``'s docstring for the same
reasoning).

Registration contract (import side effect, ordering): see ``env_registry`` (#16415).

Closes GH#7081.
